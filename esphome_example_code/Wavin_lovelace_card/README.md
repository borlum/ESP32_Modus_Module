# Wavin Lovelace Card
Add the .yaml code in a custom card in your lovelace setup. I have a Wavin Sentio system and thus I also have humidity readings.
I have made an automation that syncs all temperatures across the house if I adjust the temperature in the "Sync Temperatur" box. If I want to edit the individual temperatures I simply click on the specific room/zone and the thermostat pops up for me to adjust.

The result with black theme you can see here:
